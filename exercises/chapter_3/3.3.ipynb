    "3 - Suppose we have a data set with five predictors, $X_1$ = GPA, $X_2$ = IQ, $X_3$ = Level (1 for College and 0 for High School), $X_4$ = Interaction between GPA and IQ, and $X_5$ = Interaction between GPA and Level. The response is starting salary after graduation (in thousands of dollars). Suppose we use least squares to fit the model, and get $β_0$ = 50, $β_1$ = 20, $β_2$ = 0.07, $β_3$ = 35, $β_4$ = 0.01, $β_5$ = −10.<br>\n",

    "(b) Predict the salary of a college graduate with IQ of 110 and a GPA of 4.0.<br>\n",
    "(c) True or false: Since the coefficient for the GPA/IQ interaction term is very small, there is very little evidence of an interaction effect. Justify your answer."
